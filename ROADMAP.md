## v0.7.1 — Production Ready Follow-up ✅ Shipped 2026-05-07

Released as **v0.7.1** on 2026-05-07. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#071---2026-05-07) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.1) for the full feature list.

Tail items continue in [v0.7.2](#v072--production-ready-follow-up-2) below.

---

## v0.7.2 — Production Ready Follow-up #2 ✅ Shipped 2026-05-11

Released as **v0.7.2** on 2026-05-11. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#072---2026-05-11) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.2) for the full feature list.

Followup items continue in their own issues (#482 telemetry retention cleanup, #483 swap-path psycopg2.sql migration).

---

## v0.7.3 — Postgres Patch ✅ Shipped 2026-05-17

Released as **v0.7.3** on 2026-05-17. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#073---2026-05-17) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.3) for the full feature list.

Strict patch release — cherry-pick of PR #498 (Postgres schema-qualified `Identifier()` composition fix, closing #442) on top of the v0.7.2 line. No new features, no breaking changes. v0.8 work continues in parallel.

---

## v0.7.4 — MySQL Patch ✅ Shipped 2026-05-23

Released as **v0.7.4** on 2026-05-23. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#074---2026-05-23) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.4) for the full feature list.

Strict patch release — cherry-pick of PR #514 (MySQL `_quote_ident` applied across all SQL paths, closing #511) on top of the v0.7.3 release line. MySQL counterpart to the Postgres `Identifier()` fix that shipped in v0.7.3. PR #514 originally landed on `main` two days after the v0.7.3 tag, so the wheel published as `drt-core==0.7.3` did **not** contain it; v0.7.4 is the release that actually delivers the fix. No new features, no breaking changes. v0.8 work continues in parallel.

---

## v0.7.5 — Production Ready follow-up #3 + Tech Foundation Hardening ✅ Shipped 2026-05-25

Released as **v0.7.5** on 2026-05-25. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#075---2026-05-25) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.5) for the full feature list.

Closes the **Tech Foundation Hardening epic** ([#538](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/538), 11 child issues): CI nightly + publish gate + CodeQL + pip-audit + SBOM, DuckDB E2E harness + boundary tests, `ErrorFormatter` / `--detailed` / `--template` UX, plus load-bearing refactors (`SyncObserver` engine seam, destinations serializer + config base class consolidation, `cli/main.py` split Phase 1). Also ships the accumulated work since v0.7.4 — REST API source polish, sync catalog (#499 P1+P2), MCP test tool, OTel Phase 1 config, hardcoded secret detection, lookup ambiguity warning, orphan shadow cleanup, `drt init` "Next steps:" block. No new connectors, no breaking changes — drop-in upgrade from v0.7.2 / v0.7.3 / v0.7.4.

---

## v0.7.9 — Cloud Destinations land + Dead Letter Queue + `drt profile` ✅ Shipped 2026-06-17

Released as **v0.7.9** on 2026-06-17. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#079---2026-06-17) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.9) for the full feature list.

**The largest accumulation since v0.7.0 — the v0.8 "Cloud Destinations" half lands early on the 0.7 line.** Six new destinations: **Amazon S3** ([#168](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/168)), **Google Cloud Storage** ([#169](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/169)), **Azure Blob Storage** ([#170](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/170)) (csv/json/jsonl/parquet + gzip, on a shared blob serialiser), **Databricks Delta Lake** ([#167](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/167)), **BigQuery** ([#165](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/165) — the oldest open connector request, building on [@PFCAaron12](https://github.com/PFCAaron12)'s [#584](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/584)), and **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** ([#420](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/420)). Reliability: the **Dead Letter Queue** + `drt retry` ([#278](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/278)) persists per-record failures for replay. CLI: **`drt profile`** ([#423](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/423)) manages credential profiles. Engine: **`sync.mode: replace`** (truncate + zero-downtime swap) on Snowflake ([#434](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/434)) and Databricks ([#643](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/643)), **`sync.field_mappings`** declarative column renaming ([#415](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/415)), and Snowflake made fully queryable for `--diff` / `lookups` / `drt test` ([#468](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/468)). Tooling/hygiene: a state-based **docs/skills/MCP drift audit** + weekly workflow (connector-docs backlog now burned to **zero**), MCP server catch-up (`drt_doctor` + `compute_diff` parity), OpenTelemetry Phase 2 (NoOpTracer global provider, [#531](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/531)), and the **`/drt-troubleshoot`** skill ([#369](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/369)). No breaking changes — drop-in upgrade from v0.7.8. **v0.8.0 now reduces to the Growth / README push** (hero redesign, Quickstart GIF, blogs, Discord/X, VS Code extension) + the INFORMATION_SCHEMA correctness epic ([#317](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/317)).

## v0.7.8 — Mixpanel destination + ClickHouse identifier fix + empty-batch contract completion ✅ Shipped 2026-06-05

Released as **v0.7.8** on 2026-06-05. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#078---2026-06-05) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.8) for the full feature list.

**Community follow-up patch.** Two contributor PRs accumulated since v0.7.7 — a new **Mixpanel destination** ([#608](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/608) by [@Pawansingh3889](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889), people_set + import_events endpoints, EU residency, deterministic `$insert_id`, closes [#417](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/417)) and a **ClickHouse `_quote_ident` identifier fix** ([#610](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/610) by [@yodakanohoshi](https://github.com/yodakanohoshi)) that closes the ClickHouse leg of the qualified-identifier fix family alongside Postgres ([#498](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/498)) / MySQL ([#514](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/514)). The ClickHouse fix is the urgency lever — v0.7.7 users running `database.table` syntax hit a server-side `Code: 62` syntax error from `get_row_count`'s malformed identifier. Also completes the **empty-batch contract suite** ([#604](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/604)–[#606](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/606), 25 of 25 registered destinations) which surfaced a real bug in `staged_upload.finalize()` fixed in the same PR, ships user-facing **`sync.mode: mirror` documentation** ([#607](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/607)), the post-#608 Mixpanel wiring ([#609](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/609)), and i18n marker bump ([#603](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/603)). BigQuery destination is in flight ([#584](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/pull/584)) and will trigger v0.7.9. No breaking changes — drop-in upgrade from v0.7.7. v0.8 Cloud Destinations work continues in parallel.

---

## v0.7.7 — `sync.mode: mirror` across SQL destinations ✅ Shipped 2026-06-01

Released as **v0.7.7** on 2026-06-01. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#077---2026-06-01) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.7) for the full feature list.

The first user-facing addition since v0.7.6 is the **`sync.mode: mirror`** differential-delete sync mode ([#340](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/340)), shipping in four landings across **Postgres (#596)**, **MySQL (#597)**, **ClickHouse (#598)**, and **Snowflake (#599)** — all four SQL destinations now upsert source rows and then DELETE destination rows whose `upsert_key` was not observed in the source, without the TRUNCATE / re-insert overhead of `replace` mode. BigQuery follows once the contributor PR #584 lands (then v0.7.8). Also lands the **`cli/main.py` split completion** — Phase 2b PR (a) + PR (b) + tighten finish the 1706 → 164 LOC split (-90%) begun in v0.7.5 — plus a `FakeSource` + destination contract test framework (#592–#595), a CI `check-changelog-required` guard (#590), a GCS storage import mypy fix (#588), and CI install line extension that unlocked ~102 silently-skipped SQL destination tests (raised total coverage 82.68 → 85.29). No breaking changes — drop-in upgrade from v0.7.6. v0.8 Cloud Destinations work continues in parallel.

---

## v0.7.6 — Small follow-up ✅ Shipped 2026-05-28

Released as **v0.7.6** on 2026-05-28. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#076---2026-05-28) and the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/releases/tag/v0.7.6) for the full feature list.

Two additive features accumulated since v0.7.5 — a new **Amplitude destination** (#574, Identify API + HTTP V2 events API) and a new **`tojson_safe` Jinja2 filter** (#580 / PR #581) that unblocks `datetime` / `Decimal` / `UUID` columns flowing through REST API `body_template` rendering — plus a CLI `--log-format` typer-compatibility fix (#578), a follow-up retrofit of `ErrorFormatter` stage detection to an engine-emitted attribute (#571, supersedes the traceback-walk heuristic from #544), and Phase 2a of the `cli/main.py` split (#572, continues #565's Phase 1). No breaking changes — drop-in upgrade from v0.7.5. v0.8 work continues in parallel.

---

## v1.x — Rust Engine

Rewrite `engine/sync.py` in Rust via PyO3. Decision gated on benchmark data from v0.9 (#301). Module boundaries are already drawn for this transition — `engine/sync.py` is kept pure (no I/O side effects beyond protocol calls).
